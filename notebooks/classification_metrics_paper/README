The notebooks in this directory create the plots and tables needed for
the paper "Analysis and Comparison of Classification Metrics",
arXiv:2209.05355

Note that, unlike in the paper where class indices go from 1 to K, in
this code the class indices go from 0 to K-1 since python has 0-based
indexing.

The data used as input to these notebooks can be changed to your own
data. To do this, you can add a new option in the methods in
data.py. You can follow the example corresponding to cifar10.
